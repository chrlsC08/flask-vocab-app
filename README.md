üéì Flask Vocabulary App - Psychology Flashcards
Overview
Ever wondered how psychology students keep up with all the specialized vocabulary they need to master? I built this Flask-based web app for my girlfriend, a School Psychology grad student, to help her‚Äîand others like her‚Äîmemorize crucial terms through interactive flashcards. With this app, users can easily create, update, delete, and view vocabulary words and definitions, all within a clean, simple interface.

Not only is this a fun and useful tool for students, but it's also fully dockerized and deployed on AWS using AppRunner, with images hosted in Elastic Container Registry (ECR)‚Äîa project made to scale and serve more than just my girlfriend's flashcard needs!

‚ú® Features
Flashcards for Psychology Vocabulary: Users can add, view, update, and delete vocabulary words for seamless studying.
Vocabulary Management: Powered by an in-memory dictionary for lightning-fast lookups.
Simple API Integration: Complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API support for managing vocabulary terms.
Web-based User Interface: A user-friendly interface to manage words and meanings effortlessly.
Dockerized Deployment: Runs as a fully containerized app, ensuring consistency across environments.
Deployed on AWS: Hosted with AWS AppRunner for scalable and managed container hosting.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Flask: The app is built with Flask, a lightweight Python web framework.
Flask-SQLAlchemy: Though the current app uses an in-memory dictionary, it's future-ready for persistent databases with SQLAlchemy.
Docker: For easy containerization and deployment.
AWS AppRunner: Deploys the app with zero hassle, ensuring scalability and high availability.
